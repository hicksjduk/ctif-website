<h1>Holiday Club 2025</h1>
<h2>When is it?</h2>
Monday 28th July to Friday 1st August - 9.45am to 1.15pm. On Friday 1st August, parents/carers are invited to come along at 12.45pm to watch the 'All Together Activity'. 
<h2>Where is it?</h2>
The Holiday Club is based at Gateway Church Fareham (171-173 West Street), but activities will also take place at Fareham United Reformed Church and Fareham Methodist Church.
You will always drop off your child and pick them up from Gateway Church. Your child will be escorted safely to the other venues. 
<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
The cost of the week is Â£15 per child. However, if the cost for your child/children is a challenge for you, please let us know as we may be able to help. 
<h2>Is food provided?</h2>
Yes. The children will be given a snack during the morning, as well as lunch. 
<h2>How do I book a place for my child?</h2>
Fill in <a href="https://form.jotform.com/240794176485064">the registration form.</a> 
<p><b>Please note that demand for the holiday club is likely to be extremely high.
In fairness to everyone, we ask you only to book if you can ensure that your child 
will be able to attend all five days.</b>
