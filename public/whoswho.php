<h2><a href="mailto:chair@farehamchristians.org.uk">Rev Sam Cullen</a> - Chair</h2>
<p>I've been a Church Leader in Fareham (Holy Trinity and St Columba) since 2023.  
I'm passionate about Christians working together for the common good.  
I value the love, care, shared prayer and joint action demonstrated by CTiF.  
I feel very privileged to part of CTiF and I'm looking forward to celebrating 
our shared foundation, creating opportunities for visible unity in the town 
and drawing others into the story of God With Us.

<h2><a href="mailto:treasurer@farehamchristians.org.uk">Liz Dunning</a> - Treasurer</h2>
<p>I am a member of Fareham United Reformed Church where I am secretary 
and assistant treasurer. I love that CTiF brings us all together with  
Lent groups, ecumenical services and Christingle making! 
<p>My favourite pastime is camping but I also love gardening and cooking.

<h2><a href="mailto:secretary@farehamchristians.org.uk">Jeremy Hicks</a> - Secretary</h2>
<p>I worship at St John's Church where I am a Reader (lay preacher) and music leader. 
Before retirement I was a software engineer in the digital television industry. I enjoy cycling, 
playing and watching sport, travel, beer, and 
<a href="https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/">the annual Greenbelt festival</a>.
I met Rachel at an ecumenical Lent study group in Fareham, and we have been married 
for over thirty years. 
<p>I'm excited to be part of CTiF because of the many different ways in which we work together to bless our community.
