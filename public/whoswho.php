<h2><a href="mailto:chair@farehamchristians.org.uk">Rachel Hicks</a> - Chair</h2>
<p>I worship at St John's Church, where I am the leader of the pastoral support team. 
I am married to Jeremy, and we have a son and a grandson.
I trained as an occupational therapist, and have worked as a mental health OT in 
hospital and community settings; more recently I was a special needs assistant in 
primary schools, working with visually-impaired children. I currently lead the team that 
organises Christians Together's annual summer holiday club for children. I love being 
part of Christians Together in Fareham, because I am passionate about Christians working 
together to spread the Good News of Jesus in both word and deed.
