<h2><a href="mailto:chair@farehamchristians.org.uk">Rachel Hicks</a> - Chair</h2>
<p>I worship at St John's Church. 
I am married to Jeremy, and we have a son and a grandson.
I trained as an occupational therapist, and have worked as a mental health OT in 
hospital and community settings; more recently I was a special needs assistant in 
primary schools, working with visually-impaired children. I currently lead the team that 
organises Christians Together's annual summer holiday club for children. 
<p>I love being 
part of Christians Together in Fareham, because I am passionate about Christians working 
together to spread the Good News of Jesus in both word and deed.

<h2><a href="mailto:treasurer@farehamchristians.org.uk">Liz Dunning</a> - Treasurer</h2>
<p>I am a member of Fareham United Reformed Church where I am secretary 
and assistant treasurer. I love that CTiF brings us all together with  
Lent groups, ecumenical services and Christingle making! 
<p>My favourite pastime is camping but I also love gardening and cooking.

<h2><a href="mailto:secretary@farehamchristians.org.uk">Jeremy Hicks</a> - Secretary</h2>
<p>I worship at St John's Church where I am a Reader (lay preacher) and music leader. 
Before retirement I was a software engineer in the digital television industry. I enjoy cycling, 
playing and watching sport, travel, beer, and 
<a href="https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/">the annual Greenbelt festival</a>.
I met Rachel at an ecumenical Lent study group in Fareham, and we have been married 
for over thirty years. 
<p>I'm excited to be part of CTiF because of the many different ways in which we work together to bless our community.
