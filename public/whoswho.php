<h2><a href="mailto:chair@farehamchristians.org.uk">Rachel Hicks</a> - Chair</h2>
<p>I worship at St John's Church, where I am the leader of the pastoral support team. 
I am married to Jeremy, and we have a son and a grandson.
I trained as an occupational therapist, and have worked as a mental health OT in 
hospital and community settings; more recently I was a special needs assistant in 
primary schools, working with visually-impaired children. I currently lead the team that 
organises Christians Together's annual summer holiday club for children. I love being 
part of Christians Together in Fareham, because I am passionate about Christians working 
together to spread the Good News of Jesus in both word and deed.

<h2><a href="mailto:secretary@farehamchristians.org.uk">Ian Corless</a> - Secretary</h2>
<p>I worship at Fareham United Reformed Church where I am a non-serving elder. 
I was brought up within the Methodist tradition and worshipped across many different congregations before moving to 
Hampshire in 2004 to work for the NHS. I have worked for a number of local Primary Care Trusts and Clinical Commissioning Groups 
in the role of Board Secretary and corporate governance lead. 
I am married to Fiona, and we have two sons. We previously lived in Milton Keynes, and met and 
were married at the ecumenical Church of Christ the Cornerstone in central Milton Keynes. 
Having also worked for the Council for World Mission for a decade, I have a passion for ecumenical work 
and seen my faith enlarged through the experiences of sharing our God-given talents, skills, 
resources and knowledge in mission and worship. When not at work 
or involved in church, I am a loyal supporter of football (AFC Portchester, Havant and Waterlooville and Crystal Palace) 
and love going to live music gigs.
