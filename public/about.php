	<h1>What we do</h1>
	<p>Christians Together in Fareham is an ecumenical body uniting
		churches of a wide range of traditions: Church of England, Roman
		Catholic, Methodist, United Reformed, Baptist, Lutheran and several
		free evangelical churches.
	<p>We support and resource a variety of projects, many of which
		have their origins in Christians Together initiatives. These include
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.farehamgoodneighbours.org.uk">Fareham
				Good Neighbours</a>
		<li>an annual summer holiday club for children
		<li>the <a href="https:\/\/www.loveandcherish.org.uk"><em>Love
					and Cherish</em></a> marriage preparation course
		<li>Youth Together in Fareham
		<li>Refugee Matters
		<li>The Well
		<li>a Christmas Day lunch for those who would otherwise be alone


		
		<li>the Fareham Fairtrade Borough campaign
		<li>Christian Aid in Fareham and Portchester
		<li><a href="https://friendsofthehomeless.org.uk/">Friends of
				the Homeless</a>, and the Fareham and Gosport Basics Bank
	</ul>
	<p>We worship and pray together at the Good Friday Walk of Witness,
		on the World Day of Prayer, and in the Week of Prayer for Christian
		Unity. We organise ecumenical study groups during Lent.
	<p>We hold about four meetings a year to plan, share news and pray.
		Everyone is always welcome to our meetings.
	<p>
		A presentation which summarises many of our activities is available <a href="CTIF.pdf">here</a>.

		<li>Involving them in deeds and joyful celebration with speech,
			song, dance, movement and the written and visual arts
		<li>Inspiring and encouraging them to reawaken hope, to feel His
			peace and bring them by continuing commitment nearer to Him.
