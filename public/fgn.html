	<h1>Welcome to Fareham Good Neighbours</h1>
	<p>
		We are a voluntary organisation working under the umbrella of the <a
			href="http://www.goodneighbours.org.uk/" target="_">Good Neighbours Network</a>,
		and in partnership with <a href="http://www.farehamchristians.org.uk/">Christians
			Together in Fareham</a>.
	<p>Imagine you are unable to leave your home unaided because of a
		disability. Then imagine your relatives and friends live a long way
		off and you see no one to talk to all day long apart from a quick
		visit by a carer or meals on wheels. How lonely and isolated would you
		feel? This is the situation for many hundreds of people living in
		Fareham today.
	<p>Fareham Good Neighbours aims to alleviate the loneliness of
		people who live alone and have no family or friends nearby who are
		able to visit them. This is achieved by our volunteers agreeing to
		visit you on a regular basis (weekly or fortnightly) to chat, provide
		company, listen and, when appropriate, be a friendly person to help
		you through difficulties. Such difficulties are typically:
		understanding correspondence, dealing with tricky situations or
		assisting with suggestions on where to seek help.
	<p>Our group covers the whole of Fareham Borough with the exception
		of Stubbington Village and Hill Head.
	<p>Our volunteers do not provide personal care, shopping,
		gardening, cleaning nor transport but are there to be a friendly
		contact with our clients. Each volunteer is assigned to one (or two)
		people and, unless circumstances change, they stay with that person.
	<p>A few of our volunteers take their client out for social
		outings, such as shopping or to a garden centre for coffee. This very
		much depends on their own circumstances and the abilities of their
		client.
	<p>Our volunteers find it a very rewarding experience.
