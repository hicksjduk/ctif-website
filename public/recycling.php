<h1>Recycling</h1>
<h2><a id="foil">Aluminium foil</a></h2>
<p>The churches work together to collect foil, which is taken to the Queen Elizabeth II
Activity Centre in Manor Farm Country Park - they sell the foil for recycling, and raise money
for equipment. Foil is collected in various churches, and there are publicly-available bins at
the Palmerston Avenue car park in central Fareham, and at Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic
church in Stubbington.
<p><b>Please</b> make sure that the foil is clean, and is actually foil not shiny plastic!
If in doubt, use the 'scrunch' test - scrunch it in your hand and release it, if it stays scrunched
it is probably aluminium, if it doesn't it definitely isn't.
<h2>Other things</h2>

recycled by the council. Below are some details of which we have been notified.
