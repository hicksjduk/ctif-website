<h2>Holiday Club!</h2>
Our ecumenical summer holiday club, for children in school years 1-6, ran from 24th
to 28th July.
58 children attended, and lots of volunteers drawn from many different churches helped
to ensure the smooth running of the week.
<p>
The theme was <b>Bright Sparks</b>, and focused on Jesus, the Light of the World, and how
he brings light into our lives. Our memory verse was taken from John 8:12 - 
<i>I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will
have the light of life.</i>
<p>For more information, including links to the songs we enjoyed singing during the week,
please <a href="/holclub2023.php">visit this page.</a>

<h2>Coming soon</h2>
<img src="images/christingle-orange-12544519.jpg" align="left" height="80px">
<p>We will be holding a <b>Christingle stall</b> in West Street, as part of the festivities
around the Christmas lights switch on on Saturday 18th November. This is a wonderful opportunity
to engage with children and families about the true meaning of Christmas - the birth of Jesus,
the Light of the World.
<br>Volunteers to help with the stall will be most welcome - please email 
<a href="mailto:chair@farehamchristians.org.uk">Rachel Hicks</a> if you would like to offer
to help, or to know more.
<p>Our next meeting is on <b>Monday 20th November</b>, at 7.15 for 7.30pm, at St Philip Howard Church, 
Bishopsfield Road PO14 1QS. Everyone is welcome. <u>Please note</u> that this has been 
rearranged from the date that was originally set (Tuesday 8th November), in order to avoid a 
clash with the
licensing of Rev Sam Cullen at Holy Trinity.
