<p>The CTiF <b>Children's Holiday Club</b> was a huge success once again. Thank you to everyone
who took part, and everyone who prayed for us. The children had a wonderful time, engaging
with all the activities, singing and dancing to the songs, hearing the message of God's love
for them, and learning the memory verse: "A new commandment I give you: love one another as
I've loved you."
