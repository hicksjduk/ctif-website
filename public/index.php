<h2>Statement about recent events</h2>
<p><i>Issued on 6th August 2024</i>
<p><b>In the wake of the shocking attack on young people in Southport last week, 
and the violence that has followed in several towns and cities, Christians Together in Fareham 
want to express our love, prayers and solidarity with all the victims. As people of prayer, we 
continue to pray for those who have been injured and bereaved; as people of the truth, we reject 
all attempts to make dishonest political capital out of the suffering of the Southport victims; 
as people of justice, we condemn the scapegoating of asylum seekers, Muslims, people of colour 
and others, who bear no responsibility for what happened. We commit ourselves afresh to standing 
against hatred and violence in every form, and doing all we can to build safe, caring and strong communities.

<p>The CTiF <b>Children's Holiday Club</b> was a huge success once again. Thank you to everyone
who took part, and everyone who prayed for us. The children had a wonderful time, engaging
with all the activities, singing and dancing to the songs, hearing the message of God's love
for them, and learning the memory verse: "A new commandment I give you: love one another as
I've loved you."
