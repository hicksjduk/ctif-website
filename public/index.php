We ran a very successful <b>Christingle stall</b> as part of the festivities for
the Christmas lights switch-on in Fareham.
We welcomed almost 200 children and their families to make a Christingle, and had some
great conversations as we bore witness to the real meaning of Christmas. Many thanks
to all the volunteers, from several different churches, who came along to help out.
