<h2>Holiday Club!</h2>
Our ecumenical summer holiday club, for children in school years 1-6, ran from 24th
to 28th July.
58 children attended, and lots of volunteers drawn from many different churches helped
to ensure the smooth running of the week.
<p>
The theme was <b>Bright Sparks</b>, and focused on Jesus, the Light of the World, and how
he brings light into our lives. Our memory verse was taken from John 8:12 - 
<i>I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will
have the light of life.</i>
<p>For more information, including links to the songs we enjoyed singing during the week,
please <a href="/holclub2023.php">visit this page.</a>

<h2>Coming soon</h2>
<p><b>Christmas is coming!</b> All the churches in Fareham will soon be celebrating the
season of Advent, which starts on 3rd December, in preparation to welcome the new-born
King at Christmas. Details of services for Advent and Christmas can be found on the
websites of the different churches, which are listed on our <a href="/members.php">
Member churches</a> page.
