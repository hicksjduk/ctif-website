<h2>Holiday Club is under way!</h2>
<img src="images/brightsparks.jpg" align="right" height="200px" >
Our ecumenical summer holiday club, for children in school years 1-6, started on Monday
and runs until Friday 28th July.
We have 58 children attending, and lots of volunteers drawn from many different churches.
<p>
The theme is <b>Bright Sparks</b>, and focuses on Jesus, the Light of the World, and how
he brings light into our lives. Our memory verse is taken from John 8:12 - 
<i>I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will
have the light of life.</i>
<p>Please pray for everyone involved.
</div>
<h2>Coming soon</h2>
<p>Our next meeting is on Tuesday 19th September, at 7.30pm, at Fareham United Reformed Church, 
Osborn Road South PO16 7DG. Everyone is welcome.
