Our ecumenical summer holiday club, for children in school years 1-6, ran from Monday 24th
until Friday 28th July.
58 children attended, and almost as many volunteers, drawn from many different churches,
helped out.
<p>
The theme was <b>Bright Sparks</b>, and focused on Jesus, the Light of the World, and how
he brings light into our lives. Our memory verse was taken from John 8:12 - 
<i>I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will
have the light of life.</i>
<p>We experienced so many blessings. The children had a great time, loved the songs,
engaged with the activities, and established fantastic relationships with each other and
with the adult volunteers. Parents - many of whom had little or no link to any church -
told us how much they and their children appreciated the week.
